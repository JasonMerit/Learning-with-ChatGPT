what idea did abraham turing propose	Instead, he proposed we should rather consider a different question: Can we construct a machine that can do the same things a human can do? This may ultimately be as hard to answer as the first question, but at least we don’t have to begin our efforts by defining intelligence. A second part of Turing’s essay discuss how we might build such a human￾imitating machine. Turing proposed that instead of writing a computer program that behaves like a human from scratch, we should build a machine which initially cannot do a great many things but which can learn from past experience.

why is machine learning useful for engineer	When we as engineers consider why machine learning is important to us it is not necessarily because it will allow us to build the new self-driving car, discover the cure for cancer, or build a bridge-building robot, but because it will provide simple, off-the-shelf tools which will allow us to make efficient use of data which is already available. This book will provide an introduction to these tools. In the following sections, we will introduce basic terminology surrounding machine learning and data mining.

why is unsupervised learning necessary	Surely, we can sit down and label a few thousand of the images ourselves, train a supervised method (a classification method in this case) on the labelled images, and then use this method to determine the labels of all other animal pictures on the internet – but this is very boring and not reflective of how humans actually learn. Unsupervised learning tries to solve this and similar problems where we do not have access to any “ground-truth” label information (such as the identity of the animal in the image) but we try to discover this labelling from the data alone.

what is reinforcement learning	That is, at any given time the robot observes the state of the world (for instance a screenshot if the robot should learn to play a video game), selects an action (for instance pushing a particular button) and possibly receives a reward, for instance simply if the robot loses the video game or not. Reinforcement learning can be seen as a type of regression (i.e. supervised learning) where we are trying to predict the reward based on the current action and input signal.12 1 Introduction Fig. 1.7.

which of the following is considered a feature of the supervised learning paradigm?	High-dimensional images (each image contains 28 × 28 pixels corre￾sponding to 784 dimensions) are mapped onto a 2D domain, that is compressed into a 2-dimensional vector. Colors indicate different digits (0, 1, . , 9). Notice, digits that are the most dissimilar such as 0 and 1 are mapped to points far apart.

what is the role of a data-driven model?	A machine learning method trained to detect cars is likely to be sensitive to wheels, but will often be insensitive to the number of wheels and only have a very rough idea about where wheels are supposed to be located relative to each other, as illustrated in fig. 1.10 (center, top).

In other words, think about each observation as containing a small piece of the overall true meaning of car. Machine-learning method can pick out these pieces at varying degrees of efficiency, and as a rule less efficient than humans.

why temporal ordering is important	For instance, we could claim that the patients dataset was temporal since patients will arrive at different dates, however what matters is if this temporal ordering is considered important for the machine learning task. In the patients example, no doctor would consider it important if a patient arrives in May or June in terms of making his diagnoses, whereas in the stock market example there will typically be important upward/downward trends and causal structure which makes the temporal ordering a key feature.

A way to get around this is the median which corresponds to the value of x such that “half the observations” are greater than x and “half” are lower; i.e. the value of x that’s “in the middle” of the dataset. To put this formally, we first sort the values of x, x1, x2, .

when is zero the same as one	This is useful in some cases, for instance if the zeros and ones arise only by convention, say, we record a “zero” if a patient is a male and “one” if the patient is a female (or visa-versa), and we do not want our machine-learning method to be influenced by this rather arbitrary choice. However, for some datasets what is a zero and what is a one has an assymetric meaning. Consider the term-document example.

what is jaccard and cosine similarity	For documents there will typically be many more 0s than 1s since a document only use a fraction of the vocabulary and so, since the 0s are counted as “matches”, the SMC will be large even for documents that have nothing in common, simply because they don’t contain many of the same words: According to the SMC a recipe for ice-cream and the US constitution is quite similar since they don’t use words like Armadillo, lumberjack or vacuum cleaner. The Jaccard and cosine similarity gets around these problems by focusing on positive matches (i.e. words the documents do have in common), however with an important twist: Suppose we compare two documents x and y which are on the same topic, but x is much longer than y.

probability theory is the most likely to use	In certain important situations, if we want to build an optimal reasoning machine, it ought to reason according to probability theory.

when was the bayes theorem established	bibliographical remarks Bayes’ theorem was first described by Thomas Bayes who considered a problem very akin to the binomial distribution example we will consider in 6.4 but his work was only published after his death in 1763 [Bayes and Price, 1763], and the subject was significantly expanded by other early pioneers such as Pierre-Simon Laplace and many others.

how do probabilities work	Finally, probabilities always obey the following two rules: The sum rule: P(A|C) + P(A|C) = 1 (5.5a) The product rule: P(AB|C) = P(B|AC)P(A|C) (5.5b) Where A, B and C can be any three propositions. Note in particular we could select C as the logical constant true, C = 1. In that case, C has no bearing on the truth of A and B; after all, we always know the true constant is true, and we will use the shorthand P(A|1) = P(A).

what is your advantage in choosing a door	If you know the host never opens the door with a car is it then to your advantage to switch your choice?

That the host later tells us something about door 3 does not shuffle the goat and car around and so they remain equally likely to be behind the first two doors. Thus the chance the car is behind door 1 is still 1 2 and there is no advantage in switching.

what is the underlying assumptions of probabilities	So what went wrong with the initial argument? The argument (subtly) relied on the idea that probabilities referred to the actual state of the world and so should only change when the state of the world changes (the goat and car cannot change places because of what the game host does). In actuality, probabilities refer to our state of knowledge, and when we are given relevant knowledge about the problem, our assignment of probability may change even if the world remains the same.74 5 Discrete probabilities and information .

stochastic variable definition	This is not the case, rather, stochastic variables are simply a notational shortcuts that makes it easier to define binary propositions of the kind we have already encountered. More specifically, suppose in some situation we are measuring a quantity X. A way to think about that is (for instance) a robot that has a sensor which keep track of the acceleration (on a discrete scale), or in another example, a variable which corresponds to the number of children a family has.

Then if m = 900, we have p(b|θ) ≈ 6.6 · 10−142 . For this reason it is very common to work with logarithms of probabilities, called the log likelihood.
what is the highest probability log likelihood	In our case the log likelihood is: log L(θ) = log p(b|θ) = m log θ + (N − m) log(1 − θ) Maximizing the probability is the same as maximizing the likelihood, and learning θ by maximizing the likelihood is known as the maximum likelihood principle. In fig. 5.5 we have illustrated the likelihood function L(θ) = p(b|θ) for different values of θ, N and m. We see that as N increases, a smaller range of values of θ makes the data remotely possible. The keen eyed reader will also observe the value of θ that maximizes the probability, called the maximum likelihood estimate and referred to as θ ∗ , seems to be m N , i.e.

what weather report to send home	For instance, we can imagine a weather-station which each day send home a weather-report consisting of one of the following three events: E1 : The weather is stormy. E2 : The weather is windy but not exceedingly so. E3 : The weather is fair. What we specifically wish to quantify is the amount of information the receivers of the weather￾report obtains when they learn for instance E3 occurred. Since the events are discrete, they happen with some probability, which we will write in the usual way: P(E1) = p1, P(E2) = p2, P(E3) = p3.

which example best illustrates our measure of information?	For instance, if it is stormy nearly every day, learning it is stormy again today does not tell us much, but on the other hand, if we learn something surprising, like the weather was good, that contains a lot of information. Accordingly, our measure of information is a function of the probability of E: I(E) = I(P(E)) = I(p), where p = P(E). Let’s consider two important examples: Suppose we know an event will occur (P(E) = 1). The information we obtain by hearing that E occurred is then zero, I(E) = I(1) = 0.

what is l1 error	For the 2D dataset shown in the left-most pane, we consider a simple model (a line) but using two performance metrics: One is the standard L2 error typically used in regression, the other is the L1 error defined as the sum-of-distances between the points and the line. The middle figure illustrates the best linear models using these two methods and the circles the relative contribution of each point to the total error (the histogram in the right-hand pane are the same values sorted in ascending order). The optimal model change qualitatively between a slightly positive/negative trend because the L2 error is much more affected by outliers.

which is a measure of standard error resulting from the sum of distances	The figure illustrates the standard L2 error (square loss) and the L1 error (the sum-of-distances to prediction) and how this results in qualitatively different predictions. A temptation is to take a wait-and-see attitude where several losses are computed, however this encourage working in an ad-hoc manner where one is unable to reliably track progress. Alternatively, it may seem impossible to find such a number, in which case one should wonder if the problem is too poorly specified.

In cost complexity pruning, we construct a series of trees T0, T1, · · · , Tm where T0 is the initial (full) tree produced by Hunt’s algorithm and Tm is a tree only consisting of the root.

how to use a bayes classifier	A problem with the Bayes classifier is if M is very large, representing the conditional distribution p(x1, x2, . , xM|y), may be very expensive. For instance, for the multivariate normal distribution this requires storing a symmetric covariance matrix Σ and the mean vector µ, in total M + 1 2M(M + 1) numbers. This is not only costly, but if we do not have much data, estimating this many parameters may not be possible to do reliably.

what does factorization mean	Secondly, it allows faster computation by exploiting the factorization structure and finally it allows us easier to see what quantities are independent of each other. It is common to represent the factorization as a network where the vertices correspond to the variables and the edges correspond to statistical dependence, see fig. 13.3 for an illustration. So for instance, if there is an edge from B to A, that means that in the joint distribution, then A must be conditional on B and possible other variables connected to A.

how to find the chance of a burglary	This gives p(a, e, b) So returning to the initial question, when we determine if there was a burglar at the house we must compute p(b = 1|a = 1) which can be accomplished by marginalizing over the burglar-variable: p(b = 0|a = 1) = p(b = 0, e = 0|a = 1) + p(b = 0, e = 1|a = 1) = 0.505 p(b = 1|a = 1) = p(b = 1, e = 0|a = 1) + p(b = 1, e = 1|a = 1) = 0.494 so after receiving the call, we believe there to be a 50% chance there was a burglar in the house.

Then we can Taylor expand2 E around w 0 to obtain: E(w 0 + dw) ≈ E(w 0 ) + dw dE dw (w 0 ) (15.5) ≈ E(w 0 ) + dwg (15.6) where g = dE dw (w 0 ). (15.7) Thus, if we select dw = −g in the above we get: E(w 0 + dw) = E(w 0 ) + dwg = E(w 0 ) − g2 .
which of the following statements about the taylor expansion is true?	In other words we are guaranteed that if we let w (t) be equal to w 0 + dw = w (t−1) − g then E(w (t) ) ≤ E(w (t−1)). This decreases the error with roughly an amount g2 (this also explains why the error changes less and less in fig. 15.4). In this view, it is surprising why we don’t select  to be very large – perhaps  = 1000. The reason is that the Taylor expansion is only accurate for small values of dw, thus we can’t trust the above result when  is very large.

how to classify continuously	How do we evaluate such a classifier? The first step is to translate the continuous numbers ˆyi into binary class-predictions. The simplest way is to introduce a parameter θ and simply assign all i where ˆyi > θ to the positive class and all i where ˆyi ≤ θ to the negative class. In fig. 16.3 is shown two different thresholds.
what is the effect of thresholds	Notice, the different thresholds have a large influence on the behaviour of the classifier: If we use the high (shown in the left plot) threshold, it is very unlikely to ever say an observation that in fact is negative (yi = 0) belongs to the positive class, whereas it will be slightly prone to falsely saying an observation which is in fact positive (yi = 1) is negative. The other threshold has the opposing effect. Since the threshold is chosen arbitrarily, when we wish to discuss the performance of a classifier f, we must take into account the different threshold values.
what would happen to a classifier with a low threshold	Notice, the different thresholds have a large influence on the behaviour of the classifier: If we use the high (shown in the left plot) threshold, it is very unlikely to ever say an observation that in fact is negative (yi = 0) belongs to the positive class, whereas it will be slightly prone to falsely saying an observation which is in fact positive (yi = 1) is negative.

what is an em	Firstly, the steps of the EM algorithm might appear as arising from nothing and secondly, why should we believe the EM algorithm works? To begin with the later question, what the EM algorithm tries to do is to maximize the log of the likelihood of the data L(π, µ, Σ), and the way we will show this is simply by showing that both the M-step and the E-step increases the log-likelihood.

High confidence When the rule is triggered, i.e. someone buys X, then the person should be very likely to also buy Y . These quantities are measured by the support and confidence which, as we will see, are nothing more than dressed-up probabilities.21.1 Basic concepts 343 .

Visualization of one-dimensional data Suppose we have to visualize a single 1d dataset, for instance, the sale of widgets produces by a company over 12 months. The three most common ways to visualize this is shown in fig.

what is the difference between dot and bar chart	7.3 where we have illustrated the line plot, a “dot” plot and a bar chart. Notice the bar chart start at 0 and so should primarily be considered for variables which are ratio, i.e. 0 has some specific meaning. The use of lines often help to “ground” the eye and provide guidance when there is correspondence between observations whereas the dot and bar chart are easy to read and compare different values.

what axis is used for scatter plot	A 2D plot quickly provides an overview of how spread out the data is and in this case, it immediately tells us that determining if a flower is setosa (as opposed to the two other types) is a trivial problem whereas the other two classes, insofar as these two features are concerned, are more difficult to discern. When making 2D scatter plots, be aware of the scaling of the axes; if the units of the axes are the same (length) then it may be sensible to ensure they have the same scale. A difficulty in the 2D scatter plot is that we only see two dimensions at the same time.

what are the two problems with using a matrix plot	A matrix plot in which the four attributes are plotted pairwise against each other and colors are used to indicate class labels is impossible to solve: Firstly, this tells us nothing about how three features can perform, and secondly it only tells us about certain (axis-oriented) projections onto a 2D plane. Higher-dimensional observations To go beyond 2d requires either changing the visual element or accept some distortion. for instance one can attempt a 3D scatter plot of the data where we consider three features together as shown in fig. 7.7. The problem with 3D plots is that they have to be projected onto a 2D screen or paper which ruins most of the benefits of the 3D plot.

what is the best approach for analyzing a nonstationary dataset	In addition, we will make the assumption the dataset is stationary, which we will here loosely de￾fine as not being affected by long-running trends (for instance that the number of people at the train station is increasing over time as the train service becomes more popular). If the dataset appears to be obviously non-stationary, one should attempt to standardize it, for instance by regressing out a linear trend. It is at this point tempting to turn the prediction problem into simply predicting y at step i based on features corresponding to step i − 1 and so on.

In addition, we will make the assumption the dataset is stationary, which we will here loosely de￾fine as not being affected by long-running trends (for instance that the number of people at the train station is increasing over time as the train service becomes more popular).

which strategy will result in observation overlap?	The rows represent three schemes for selecting training and test splits: Random splits Training/test splits are selected non-overlapping and at random Consequtive splits As above, but the K folds consist of consecutive observations Rolling The test set is always in the future relative to the training set A difficulty is that training observation xi will contain yi−1, and in general for embeddings of size p observation xi will contain observations yi−p, . , yi−1. This means the training and test sets will overlap which in turn means we are likely to under-estimate the generalization error. For that reason, it is often desirable to pad the test set by removing a set of observations on each side corresponding to the correlation length in the data, here assumed to be roughly the embedding size.

what is the advantage of random splitting over the training set?	10.14.184 10 Overfitting and cross-validation A few remarks are at this point in order for (possible) advantages and disadvantages of the different methods: The random and consecutive splits are likely to behave quite similar without padding, however with padding, and in particular if the dataset is very small, padding will remove proportionally more of the data for random splits (biasing the generalization error estimate up￾wards). On the other hand, selecting splits consecutively rather than randomly mean the data in the test set in each fold will overlap, thereby increasing the variance of the generalization error estimate. For both the random and consecutive selections, a problem is we include the future in the training set, whereas in the real world we will train on past data and test on future.

what is association mining	The basic association mining framework presented here only considers all transactions and therefore mix different costumer segments thereby potentially missing important segment specific associations if these segments are not somehow identified prior to the analysis (for instance using some clustering approach). While our initial motivation for association mining was the analysis of market baskets, i.e. the transactions of customers and their items purchased, association mining has very general applicabil￾ity.

where can an association mining technique be applied?	For instance association mining can be used within medicine (i.e., identifying patterns such as if you have these and these symptoms it is likely you also have these symptoms), bioinformatics (i.e., identifying association between genes), and general questionnaire data (i.e., if you answered this and this it is likely you will also answer this) to mention but a few potential domains of application. The Apriori algorithm assumes binary features whereas in many real applications, datasets may not be binary and therefore some type of binarization must be invoked prior to the analyses. How to binarize the data can be unclear whereas the binarization may influence results.

binarization of an attribute in java	For instance if we binarize an attribute such as age we could simply threshold by the median value (i.e. 50th percentile) or use one-out-of-K coding to include multiple binary features each denoting different age interval. In this case, the binarization will heavily influence the support, i.e.
