       "       ' Much of it has focused on the diplomatic events of the mid- and late  1930s in Europe, though more recently there has been an upsurge of interest both in the  years immediately following the peace settlement of 1919 and on the wider origins of the  conflict It is no easy task for students to pick their way through this daunting mass of  material, and to arrive at a clear view of the central issues involved in the outbreak of a  European war in 1939, or of why this war escalated into a global conflict in 1941 Not  only are there hundreds of volumes of official papers and documents issued by various  governments covering the period, but it is also the subject of some fierce controversies  and historical debates  The aim of this pamphlet is to present, as clearly as possible, the reasons for the  outbreak of war in 1939 and for the worldwide escalation of the conflict by 1941, just  twenty years after the signing of the peace treaties which concluded the ‘war to end all  wars’, the First World War Why did the settlements of 1919 prove so fragile, despite the  strong sentiments of ‘no more war’ voiced so repeatedly by so many war-weary  combatants and their families in the years immediately after the war Obviously not all  First World War veterans were supporters of the peace treaties, particularly those who  had fought on what turned out to be the losing side, and not all set their faces against the  use of force in the future to change some or all of the terms We know that defeat came as  a great shock to the German people and led to accusations of betrayal levelled at alleged  ‘traitors’ who had sabotaged the German war effort and push to victory Clearly Hitler did not act in isolation, and much  attention has been paid in recent years to the ways in which decisions were taken in Nazi  Germany after 1933, the extent of collaboration with Hitler of the German army, big  business and government officials, and the ambitions and motives of other national  leaders, such as Mussolini, and the traditions and policy objectives of their governments  The pamphlet is divided into four chapters The first considers the long-term causes of  the war, such as the political and territorial fragility of the post-war settlement, the  economic weaknesses of the major European powers in the 1920s and the growing  ideological divide which generated such strong social and political tensions both within  countries and across the globe by the mid-1930s The second chapter outlines the  successive crises which led eventually to the outbreak of war in Europe in 1931, and to  worldwide war by 1941 It examines the main elements of Hitler’s  ideological beliefs, and looks at the speed and scale of his rearmament programme after  1933, alongside the growth in territorial ambition of both Fascist Italy and ultra\\ufffenationalist Japan The successive crises unleashed by the Japanese invasion of Manchuria  in 1931 and the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 are considered alongside Hitler’s  remilitarization of the Rhineland in 1936 and the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in the  same year This chapter then examines the impact of the Anschluss with Austria and  crisis over the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia in 1938, the invasion of Prague in March  of 1939, and the conclusion of the Nazi—Soviet Pact of August 1939, alongside Japan’s  invasion of China in 1937 and Italy’s growing Mediterranean ambitions',\n",
       "       '  The third chapter of the pamphlet examines the many different interpretations of the  causes of the Second World War which have been put forward by historians since 1945  Much of the material focuses on Adolf Hitler, about whom it is claimed that more has  been written than about any individual in history other than Jesus Christ  Was Hitler a degenerate psychopath, as King Victor Emmanuel of Italy described him  in 1938, or ‘probably mad’ as Britain’s Foreign Secretary in 1938 suggested, whose  policies were bound to result in war sooner or later, or was his foreign policy acually  ‘that of his predecessors, of the professional diplomats at the foreign ministry and indeed  of virtually all Germans’ (A.J.P Could British and French leaders have averted  war up to 1939 by pursuing different policies, policies of deterrence, and by working  more closely with Mussolini or with Stalin And how important was the contribution of Italian expansionist ambitions and  Japanese aggression to the outbreak of war in 1939 and to the subsequent worldwide  escalation of that war This chapter aims not to provide definitive answers to these  questions but to provide a guide through the main controversies and arguments, focusing  on the most salient points and helping students to form their own coherent and considered  views on the main points of debate  The fourth and concluding chapter consists of a bibliographical guide to those books  and pamphlets which students may find most useful for their work It is inevitably  selective, but offers suggestions for further reading, either to give a more detailed general  picture of the way events unfolded in the 1930s or to follow up on specific topics This pamphlet is my attempt to offer some guidance and a clear path through  the maze  The origins of the second world war 1933–1941 2 robin-bobin1  Long–term causes  Many accounts of the origins of the Second World War focus almost exclusively on  European diplomacy in the years between 1933 and 1939, starting with Adolf Hitler’s  appointment as German Chancellor on 30 January 1933 and ending with Britain’s  declaration of war on Germany on 3 September 1939 after the German invasion of  Poland Yet while the events of these six years are clearly crucial in any evaluation of the  reasons for the outbreak of war in 1939, they cannot provide a complete explanation The  reason goes back to the Great War of 1914–18 and its impact, not just on the European  nations who took part but on relations between Europe and the wider world Winston  Churchill, in the preface to the first volume of his Second World War memoirs, referred  to the period 1914–1945 as ‘another Thirty Years War’ And whilst the great powers of Europe, victors as well as the defeated  nations, were gravely weakened by the long and gruelling conflict, the United States and  Japan had emerged, from opposite sides of the globe, considerably strengthened  economically and militarily Both powers could, if they chose, mount a significant  challenge to Britain’s naval supremacy and to the worldwide territories of the British and  French empires  The significant shift in power from Europe to the United States, which was very  evident in the 1920s, added to the complex problems faced by the major European  powers in the aftermath of the First World War, and undermined attempts to achieve  political and economic stability Significantly, E.H.Carr entitled his study of the  international relations of the inter-war period (written soon after the outbreak of the  Second World War) The Twenty Years’ Crisis',\n",
       "       ' As we shall see,  social tensions, economic weakness, ideological divisions and the political fragility of the  new states of eastern and south-eastern Europe all contributed to the perception of a  weakened and crisis–torn Europe And at the heart of Europe, most crucially, the First  World War had failed to resolve ‘the German problem’ Taylor, in his controversial account of the origins of the Second World War,  claims that the war was ‘implicit since the moment when the first World war ended’,  because of the failure of that war either to satisfy German ambitions or to crush them  completely His view is that ‘The first World war explains the second and in fact caused  it, in so far as one event causes another’ These ambitions, he  argued, were there already before the First World War and remained strong throughout  the inter-war period Defeat in the First World War was regarded as a temporary setback  and, according to Taylor, ‘Germany fought specifically in the second World war to  reverse the verdict of the first and to destroy the settlement which followed it’  Few historians accept this analysis as it stands Furious arguments have raged in the  past forty years over the aims and objectives of different groups in German society: were  the ambitions of army officers or officials in the German Foreign Office really the same  as those of Nazi leaders And was the principal thrust of German foreign policy in the  1930s simply to destroy the Versailles settlement, or was this destruction just a first step  in a programme aiming at European or even world domination  None the less, Taylor is right to draw our attention to two important long-term causes  of the Second World War—the fragility of the peace settlement which followed the  ending of the First World War, and indeed the inconclusive outcome of that conflict  itself As he perceptively pointed out, ‘The first World war left “the German problem”  unsolved…she remained by far the greatest power on the continent of Europe; with the  disappearance of Russia, more so than before She was greatest in population…Her  preponderance was greater still in the economic resources of coal and steel.’ The peace  treaty was concluded with ‘a united Germany Germany had only to secure a  modification of the treaty, or to shake it off altogether, and she would emerge as strong,  or almost as strong, as she had been in 1914’  The First World War had left Europe economically weak and politically unstable Could these emerging  small nations establish themselves with sufficient political and economic strength, at a  sufficient speed to fight off renewed German or Russian expansionist ambitions For the  time being, German eastern ambitions, starkly exposed in the treaty of Brest-Litovsk,  which was forced onto a defeated Russia in March 1918, had been thwarted–but by  military defeat in the west of Europe, not in the east Meanwhile the Bolshevik leader  Lenin—helped by the German military command to return to Russia from Switzerland in  1917 – was in the process of establishing a new socialist republic in Russia, which served  to intensify ideological divisions and sharpen social conflicts throughout Europe  It was with the greatest difficulty that the victorious allied and associated powers  managed to draw up a peace settlement at all',\n",
       "       ' For, as Taylor pointed out, the  peace settlement was drawn up on the assumption that a democratic, republican Germany  would cooperate in carrying it out Many of its terms, relating to German disarmament  and payment of reparations, could not be put into effect without German consent and  collaboration But the new Weimar government was too weak to secure that consent, and  Britain and France were left with the problem of whether to impose the Treaty of  Versailles by force or to agree to more lenient terms in return for German promises to  carry them out  The origins of the second world war 1933–1941 4 robin-bobinHere was the first major post-war problem: Germany had lost the First World War, but  large and important sections of post-war Germany accepted neither that defeat nor the  peace settlement which followed it as a fair or final outcome No German government in  the 1920s could readily agree to allied treaty demands without incurring widespread  public hostility These Jews, socialists, communists and other  traitors were alleged to have ‘stabbed Germany in the back’ by fomenting demonstrations  and strikes in German industrial areas, thus preventing her army from winning the  glorious victory which was so nearly within its grasp  The Social Democratic Party, which shouldered the responsibility of signing the peace  dictat and which tried to advocate some measure of compliance with its terms, lost  electoral support as a result The more right-wing political parties, which held the balance  of power in Germany for most of the 1920s, never concealed their hostility towards the  Versailles settlement and their intention to work for its gradual overthrow Army officers  plotted to evade the disarmament provisions in secret talks with the Bolshevik  government, while industrialists in the Ruhr refused to hand over to France the required  reparations quotas of coal and coke Once this had been achieved, Stresemann clearly had his sights set  on territorial adjustments in the east How extensive these would have been we do not  know, but the Polish Corridor, Danzig and the Polish part of Upper Silesia were elements  of the 1919 territorial settlement which no German government of the 1920s and no  foreign minister accepted as more than provisional It is significant that the new states of  Poland, Czechoslovakia and Romania were referred to in Germany as Saisonsstaaten— states born to die within a single season: annuals rather than perennials like Germany or  France  Then there was the question of relations with Austria, many of whose inhabitants  favoured the idea of some kind of union with Germany, even though a formal Anschluss or political union had been prohibited by the peace settlement At what stage should  Germany raise the possibility of closer economic collaboration with Austria as a prelude  to a more political partnership Now they were  minorities in states dominated by Poles or Czechs and Slovaks, or were inhabitants of a  newly created nation called ‘Austria’, nearly half of whose population lived in the capital  Vienna, many facing economic hardship and unemployment What should Germany’s  attitude be to these German speakers living beyond Germany’s present frontiers  Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points had promised self-determination for the people of  the Habsburg empire, but not, it appeared, if they were German Thus extreme nationalist  groups within Germany were able to exploit Wilsonian idealism and draw attention to the  grievances and future aspirations of Germans living in small countries surrounding  Germany, and their campaigns could not be ignored by any German government seeking  to maintain its electoral support',\n",

It  would be wrong to see the years 1924–9 as a ‘golden period’ of peace and hope in the  inter-war history of Germany and of Europe Problems remained to be solved and serious  tensions persisted On the other hand, these were being contained by the various  government coalitions, and challenges from right and from left did not pose serious  threats It took three years of severe economic dislocation and widespread social distress  to bring about substantial political changes throughout Europe, including a national  coalition government in Britain and a National Socialist Chancellor in Germany  Ironically, the economic situation in Germany was beginning to improve just as Hitler  came to power He was therefore able to claim the full credit for economic recovery For Hitler was no ordinary party leader and the Nazis did not  behave like members of more traditional political parties They laid great stress on visual  and verbal impact—on uniforms, on emblems such as swastikas, on endlessly repeated  slogans and on carefully staged parades and marches The use of violence was an integral  part of their struggle for recognition and power, and attracted as many followers as it  repelled Their meeting places were not only back rooms in cafés and beer cellars but also  street corners and public open spaces where Hitler could harangue his listeners and whip  them up into a frenzy, while his armed bodyguards beat up dissenters and political  opponents The party message was kept simple: traitors inside Germany had conspired  with enemies abroad to defeat Germany in 1918 and to keep it weak since that time The  Nazis demanded that these traitors be replaced by loyal German patriots like themselves,  so that Germany could be ‘redeemed’ and regenerated It would  then regain its natural mastery of central and south-eastern Europe, denied to it in the  1920s by an international conspiracy organized by Jews and communists With Hitler at  the helm and the Nazis by his side, a greater Germany, embracing all Germans including  those at present living outside Germany’s present frontiers, would achieve its destiny  through the establishment of a thousand-year Third Reich (The First Reich had been the  medieval Holy Roman Empire of the German nation, and the Second had been the  German empire as established by Bismarck in 1871.)  Those who managed to read through all the turgid prose of Mein Kampf (My Struggle), written by Hitler while imprisoned in Landsberg fortress after his premature bid for  power in the Beer Hall putsch in Munich in November 1923, could find these ideas  developed obsessively and at great length A second book, even more explicit and obsessive than Mein Kampf in relation to Germany’s destiny and to the factors which dictated the rise and fall of great  powers, was written in 1928 though not published during Hitler’s lifetime But what all  these writings and speeches had in common was an exaggerated emphasis on what Hitler  regarded as the key determinants in human history: racial struggle and the survival of the  fittest As Ian Kershaw has pointed out, these two themes had been central to Hitler’s  thinking since the 1920s And his obsession with race was combined with concerns about  space, since his study of history had convinced him that successful nations needed to  secure adequate living space and food resources in order to consolidate their strength and  to expand  robin-bobinNazi ideology was fundamentally racist, based on the idea that a hierarchy of races  existed throughout the world',\n",
       "       ' Other races, notably eastern ones, could carry culture but not create it, and yet  others, such as the black races, were destructive of superior races and were incapable of  being either creative or of carrying culture Thus the Aryan peoples had a responsibility  to maintain and to strengthen their racial purity—Hitler described it as their ‘mission,  ordained by God’ As he put it in Mein Kampf, ‘We are members of the highest species of  humanity on this earth,…we have a correspondingly high duty and…we shall fulfil this  duty only if we inspire the German people with the racial idea, so that they will occupy  themselves not merely with the breeding of good dogs and horses and cats, but also care  for the purity of their own blood’  Only a racially pure nation would possess the strength to expand and to win the  struggle for survival against other nations As another Nazi leader, Josef Goebbels, put it  in the late 1920s, ‘we must have a healthy people in order to prevail in the world’ As Hitler explained in his second book,  domestic policy was the ‘art of securing for a nation the strength, in the shape of racial  quality and numbers, necessary to secure living space’ Thus race and space were  inextricably linked; a racially pure Germany would inevitably expand and require more  living space, or Lebensraum, in central or eastern Europe  But such living space would not be won without conflict A second fundamental Nazi  belief was in life as a constant, ceaseless struggle for supremacy, for resources and for  power Their thinking was based on crude social Darwinist ideas about the ‘survival of  the fittest’, in which the conclusions of Charles Darwin’s scholarly researches into  selection and evolution amongst plants and animals had been transposed to the social  realm According to this view, humans inevitably competed against each other, and the  strongest and most biologically fit survived and dominated As Hitler wrote in 1928, ‘Wherever our success may end, that will always be  only the starting point of a new fight’ Men and women had to be ready for the struggle,  ready to fulfil their historic destiny and, in the case of the Aryans, ready to lead War was  an inevitable part of this constant battle to secure a dominant position and to impose  power on lesser peoples Failure to compete, failure to maintain purity, any undermining  of the will to win or degeneration of racial purity would lead to domination by others, and  all the shame and dishonour that this would bring This, according to Hitler, was the fate  which had befallen Germany in 1918 when the German army had not been defeated in  the field but had been prevented from winning the victory within its grasp because of  betrayal by enemies within: communists, socialists and Jews  The most dangerous of Germany’s enemies, as far as Hitler was concerned, were the  Jews But, by fusing traditional anti-Semitic sentiments with his racial  theories, Hitler portrayed the Jews not only as enemies of Christianity or as ruthless  capitalist exploiters of the poor but also as racial defilers He claimed to have discovered  a pernicious Jewish virus, which, if not isolated, would contaminate German blood and  The origins of the second world war 1933–1941 12 robin-bobincause ‘national race tuberculosis’ He seriously claimed, near the end of his life, that his  work in isolating and eliminating this Jewish virus was as significant for humanity as  Louis Pasteur’s success in isolating germs had been in the nineteenth century, and  therefore that he too deserved to receive the Nobel prize In Hitler’s view, Jews were not  a race as such, they were parasites who tried to fasten upon racially pure bodies and  pollute their blood Thus they had to be isolated and fought by every means possible',\n",
       "       ' Thus a struggle for living space  with Bolshevik Russia, which seemed to Hitler to be inevitable at some point in the  future, would also have the virtue of continuing the life-or-death struggle against the Jew  Hitler’s ideas were certainly extreme, but they were not particularly new Many of his  beliefs had been common currency amongst pan-German groups in Vienna and in  Munich at the turn of the century, and the aim of German territorial expansion eastwards  had been firmly on the agenda of the German high command in the First World War  What Hitler managed to do, however, was to distil his thinking into a few recognizable  themes outlined in Mein Kampf and in subsequent Party publications, which could be  endlessly repeated, and then to identify new and persuasive ways of putting his message  across Hitler could captivate,  inspire and enthral an audience like no other German leader of the inter-war period, and  the economic crisis in Germany from 1929 onwards gave him his opportunity He took it  firmly with both hands  The consolidation of the Nazi regime The nationalist leaders who had worked so hard to persuade Hindenburg to install Hitler  as German Chancellor calculated that once in office the rabble-rouser would settle down  to become a more orthodox political leader They assumed that his violent and extreme  Nazi followers would be disarmed and put under police control They gambled on the  responsibilities of office serving to moderate the extreme views and policies which had  brought him to power, and on pressurizing him to seek compromise with the more  traditional right-wing nationalists in the Cabinet In fact, quite the reverse happened, as  Hitler’s first six hectic months in power soon revealed  He immediately called for new Reichstag elections and secured a 44 per cent Nazi  vote by a combination of propaganda, intimidation and violence, using the full state  apparatus to great effect to whip up maximum support throughout Germany In the course  of the election campaign, the Reichstag, the headquarters of the German parliament, was  destroyed by a fire which Hitler immediately declared to have been the first stage of a  communist conspiracy to overthrow the government and to turn Germany into a  communist state In fact, there is no evidence to support this contention, and rumour  circulated at the time that it was the work of Nazi agents out to discredit the communists  More recently, there has been speculation that the Dutch anarchist arrested on the  The years 1933–41 13 robin-bobinpremises at the time was working completely on his own Whatever the true explanation,  the fire gave Hitler and the Nazis the opportunity to pose as the saviours of Germany  against the Red Peril It was turned first against the communists, and then against the other political  parties in turn The new Reichstag passed an enabling act which allowed Hitler and his  government to dispense with constitutional forms and limitations for four years in order  to deal with the country’s problems At the same time, within the different states of  Germany, Reich commissioners were installed to ‘maintain order’ and purge ‘unreliable  elements’ from public services and particularly from the police force By the summer of  1933, all political parties in Germany had been dissolved or eliminated, leaving the Nazis  as the only legal party Moves were initiated to purge the civil service in such a way as to  ensure that its members were politically reliable and of pure Aryan stock, untainted by  Semitic blood',\n",

       "       ' But it was very clear from its wartime activities, in taking  over German Chinese concessions and possessions in the Pacific, and in imposing the  notorious Twenty-One Demands in 1915 on a weak Chinese government, that Japan was  using the alliance with Britain to expand its economic and strategic power in China and  in the Pacific region At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, Japan was for the first time  recognized as a great power, with a permanent seat on the Council of the new League of  Nations But its demands for permanent concessions and extended rights in Shantung  province in China, and in Manchuria, caused consternation in the United States, and  strong American pressure forced Japan to pull out of Shantung in 1922  Thus in 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty, limiting large capital ships, was  concluded between the United States, Britain, Japan, France and Italy The Anglo\\ufffeJapanese alliance was replaced by a much looser US—British—Japanese—French four\\ufffepower agreement to respect each other’s possessions and territories in the Pacific region,  and the United States, Britain and France agreed not to increase their naval fortifications  in the western Pacific area, thus ruling out any strengthening of their bases at Manila,  Guam or Hong Kong While it seemed on the surface, therefore, that Japanese  expansionist ambitions had been contained, strong nationalist and imperialist passions  remained, particularly centred on the armed forces  An important concession which Japan had been granted in 1905, after its victory in the  war against Russia, was the right to station soldiers in Manchuria to guard the strategic  rail network which ran through the province Japanese  commanders were increasingly drawn into Manchurian politics, as they sought to keep  north China weak And, while the Japanese government worked cooperatively in the  1920s with other powers in the League of Nations, army and navy leaders grew  increasingly scornful of what they saw as Japanese politicians kowtowing to western  governments and failing to safe-guard vital national interests Passions finally boiled over  when, in 1930, the Japanese government concluded with Britain and America the naval  treaty of London, which limited the numbers of cruisers which each of the powers could  have, to a ratio of ten, ten, and seven (for Japan) Though the Japanese government  finally managed to ratify the treaty, army and navy leaders and ultra-nationalist groups  whipped up a frenzied campaign against the treaty, which then escalated into wide-scale  attacks against political parties, government leaders and anyone who dared to express  support for the naval treaty  Claiming that a bomb had been placed on the railway line at Mukden, Japanese troops  stationed in Manchuria fanned out of the railway zones to occupy the whole of south  Manchuria The Chinese government appealed to the League of Nations to intervene and  to order the Japanese troops back to their former positions, but, while the Japanese  government was formally cooperative at Geneva, the army in Manchuria continued its  seizure of territory, until it had occupied the whole of the Manchurian province A  League of Nations enquiry team, led by the British peer Lord Lytton, was despatched to  the Far East on a fact-finding mission Its report, which blamed China as well as Japan  for disrupting trade and contributing to instability in the region, called on Japanese troops  to withdraw back to their railway-zone bases',\n",

       "       '  In Britain, however, in the years immediately after the war, the focus for debate was  not on Hitler’s ambitions, which seemed fairly clear-cut, or on those who helped him to  realize them, but on the ‘guilty men’, those western leaders who failed to grasp his evil  intentions early enough and who appeased him until it was too late The distinguished  historical authority on the politics of the reign of George III, Sir Lewis Namier, wrote a  book in 1950 entitled Diplomatic Prelude in which he argued:  The issue of a crisis depends not so much on its magnitude as on the  courage and resolution with which it is met The second German bid for  world domination found Europe weak and divided  This harsh verdict on the British and French leaders of the 1930s was echoed by Winston  Churchill, who subtitled his book The Gathering Storm (volume I of his account of The  Second World War), ‘How the English-speaking peoples through their unwisdom,  carelessness and good nature allowed the wicked to rearm’ According to Churchill, the  war should have been called ‘The Unnecessary War’ since ‘There never was a war more  easy to stop’ However, Namier, Churchill and others who had wanted Britain to take a  stand against German aggression much earlier than in 1939 did not always agree on the  exact point at which resistance to Hitler would have been most effective Churchill  believed that the allies should have intervened in 1934 or 1935 to prevent Nazi Germany  from rearming, and particularly from establishing a powerful air force Many people still felt the shame of the Munich  ‘sell-out’ and the betrayal of Czechoslovakia, and attacked British and French leaders for  agreeing in October 1938 to the incorporation of the Sudetenland into Germany, thus  paving the way for the dismemberment of the Czech republic some five months later  Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, the ‘appeasers’, as Chamberlain, Hoare, Lord  Halifax, Laval and Bonnet were disparagingly called, received a universally hostile press  They were portrayed as stupid and pathetic men, frightened to stand up to Hitler and  prepared instead to offer up territories and peoples in eastern Europe in a vain attempt to  satisfy Hitler’s insatiable appetite It was argued that they should have realized by 1936 at  the latest that they were dealing with a tyrant who needed to be stopped at the earliest  opportunity The Appeasers, written by two Oxford  graduates in their mid-twenties, Martin Gilbert and Richard Gott and published in 1963,  was the first comprehensive treatment of the factors shaping inter-war British  appeasement, but its verdict on Chamberlain was nevertheless still a harsh one In their  view, ‘British policy, far from appeasing Hitler, showed him that the British Government  were willing to come to terms with him at the expense of other nations’ Appeasement  was ‘an attempt to move closer to Germany, despite German domestic brutality and  eastward expansion It failed.’  In this immediate post-war period, German historians were concerned not so much  with Hitler’s expansionist aims and British and French failure to check them as with his  rise to power and the extent to which he was supported by the German electorate',\n",
       "       ' Detailed studies began  to show that Hitler’s Germany was not an efficient and effective dictatorship but a  ramshackle structure, with competing spheres of influence containing uneasy  compromises between the old ruling elites and the new Nazi rulers There was resistance  to Hitler’s rule, though it was sporadic and often concealed from public view  But the debate about the role of Hitler in relation to the outbreak of the Second World  War, and the extent to which he was aided and abetted by British and French  appeasement policies, really took off in earnest with the publication in 1961 of A.J.P  Taylor’s Origins of the Second World War, a book which was to exert an enormous  influence over students and general readers alike in the course of the following forty  years Alan Taylor was a well-respected historian of modern German and European  history, about which he had written widely and eloquently, in works such as The Course  of German History and The Habsburg Monarchy While he followed previous historians in criticizing western leaders  for their inconsistent policies, he added two additional ingredients, the first of which  quickly raised the temperature of the historical debate to boiling point For he asserted  that Hitler, far from being a uniquely villainous German leader, was merely continuing  the policy of previous German governments in seeking eastward expansion The basic  problem confronting European statesmen after 1919, argued Taylor, was not Hitler or the  expansionist ideology of National Socialism, but German ambitions which had been  checked but not completely crushed by the First World War  Taylor claimed that, in aiming to make Germany the ‘dominant power in Europe and  maybe, more remotely in the world’, Hitler was pursing ambitions no different from  those held by German leaders before 1914 or by Stresemann and other Weimar leaders in  the 1920s Most of all, he was the creation of German  history and of the German present’, Taylor asserted, and furthermore reminded readers  that ‘He would have counted for nothing without the support and co-operation of the  German people… In principle and in doctrine Hitler was no more wicked and  unscrupulous than many other contemporary statesmen.’ However Taylor did concede  that ‘in wicked acts he outdid them all’ Interestingly, the publication in the same year of  the first of Professor Fritz Fischer’s meticulously researched volumes on imperial  The origins of the second world war 1933–1941 46 robin-bobinGerman foreign policy up to and into the First World War, Griff nach der Weltmacht, which was not translated into English until 1966, exposed for the first time the scale of  German annexationist ambitions in central and eastern Europe in the early part of the  century, thus giving considerable credibility to Taylor’s ‘continuity’ thesis  Thus the vital question for Taylor centred not on Hitler’s policies but on those of the  western leaders Given aggressive German ambitions and an unresolved ‘German  problem’ in the period after 1919, why did British and French leaders not resist German  claims in the mid-1930s, and then why did they suddenly, in 1939, decide to take a stand  over Poland Taylor’s book therefore shifted the debate away from Hitler, the planner  and architect of war, to Hitler the opportunist, whose traditional if substantial German  appetite was continually being whetted by the concessions offered to him by British and  French leaders whenever he raised the question of German grievances Hitler himself,  according to Taylor, had no concrete plans There was ‘no clear dividing line in his mind  between political ingenuity and small wars, such as the attack on Poland',\n",
       "       ' Instead, he  merely seized opportunities as they arose The Austrian crisis of March 1938 ‘was  produced by Schuschnigg not by Hitler’ The Sudeten crisis was created by the Sudeten  Nazis who ‘built up the tension gradually, without guidance from Hitler’; Hitler then  ‘merely took advantage of it’ After October 1938, Hitler knew that the Munich  settlement could not work, since an ‘independent Czechoslovakia could not survive when  deprived of her natural frontiers and with Czech prestige broken’ The result, ‘neither  sinister nor premeditated’, was a German occupation of Prague, followed by a Polish  crisis forced on him by the Polish Foreign Minister Beck Hitler was not really planning  for war in 1939, and the proof of this, according to Taylor, lay in the level of German  rearmament by 1939, which was by no means great enough to sustain a European, let  alone a world, war Such  were the origins of the second World war…’  Not surprisingly, Taylor’s interpretation, brilliantly written and persuasively argued,  caused howls of protest and unleashed a torrent of replies and rebuttals But as Professor  Max Beloff commented perceptively at the time, in the Sunday Telegraph, ‘no one who  has digested this enthralling work will ever be able to look at the period again in quite the  same way’ Those historians who were appalled by Taylor’s cavalier use of primary  evidence and by the conclusions he reached produced detailed rebuttals and scholarly  articles taking issue with his general thesis and drawing attention to his selective use and  abuse of source material The effect of the growing controversy was to  widen considerably the scope of the debate about the origins of the Second World War,  and to stimulate research into a number of important fields such as Nazi ideology,  continuity and change in inter-war German foreign policy, the factors shaping Nazi  foreign policy after 1933, and the extent to which Hitler and the Nazis were preparing  Germany for war by 1938 Though Taylor’s account remained enormously popular and  accessible to students and to general readers, its narrow focus on diplomacy and its  narrative approach to Anglo-German relations within an exclusively European context  was looking distinctly outdated and inadequate a decade or two later in light of the  extensive research which was undertaken in the 1960s and 1970s, not just into Nazi  foreign policy and the responses to it in Europe, but into Soviet, Japanese and United  States ambitions as well Gerhard Weinberg, a German-born academic working on captured  German documents in the United States after the war, discovered and published Hitler’s  Second Book, which had been written in 1928 but not published during Hitler’s lifetime  On the evidence of this and of the extensive documentation he studied, Weinberg argued,  in a book published in 1970 entitled The Foreign Policy of Hitler’s Germany: Diplomatic  Revolution in Europe 1933–36, that, far from being a pure opportunist, Hitler in fact ‘had  some very definite, fixed ideas on foreign policy before he came to power’ and that  ‘during the years from 1933 to 1939 Hitler kept these ideas very much in mind in the  actual conduct of affairs, though he tended to reserve oral and written expression of them  to the privacy of the conference room or the circle of his associates’ According to  Weinberg, ‘Hitler’s ideology consisted primarily of two related systems of ideas’,  revolving around ‘race’ and ‘space’',\n",
       "       ' A racially strong and  expanding German population would require more space, defined by Hitler as  agriculturally useful land Thus an ‘adjustment of space to population’ would have to take  place, through  the conquest of additional land areas whose native population would be  expelled or exterminated, not assimilated The availability of such land  areas would in turn encourage the good, healthy Nordic couples settled on  them to raise large families that would both make up for the casualties  incurred in the conquest of the territory and assure adequate military  manpower for subsequent wars they would need to wage In an earlier article, published  in 1964 in the Journal of Modern History, Weinberg had referred to a comment by  The origins of the second world war 1933–1941 48 robin-bobinRudolf Hess, Hitler’s companion in Landsberg prison, that Hitler was of the opinion that  world peace could come only ‘when one power, the racially best one, has attained  complete and uncontested supremacy’ It would then establish a world police and assure  itself ‘the necessary living space… The lower races will have to restrict themselves  accordingly’ Hitler himself outlined the expansion process in his Second Book as he  envisaged it would develop: ‘We consider our (anticipated) sacrifices, weigh the size of  the possible success, and will go on the attack, regardless of whether it will come to a  stop 10 or 1,000 kilometres beyond the present lines In his book  Hitler’s War Aims, published in 1973, he wrote that  The assumption that the past and future of human civilization depended  exclusively on the Aryans, that therefore they alone among the peoples of  the earth deserved to live and prosper—this was the basis on which rested  the entire superstructure of Hitler’s ideological program, his concept of  the role of party and state, his plans for the future of the German people  Race, far from being a mere propagandistic slogan, was the very rock on  which the Nazi church was built Hitler never appears to have had any  doubts about the literal truth of his racial theories, nor did his more fanatic  followers The elimination of the French threat would have and would retain  significance only if it provided the rear cover for an enlargement of the  German domain in Eastern Europe National Socialism, therefore,  consciously abandoned the foreign policy of the Second Reich Germany  was to cease its fruitless pursuit of a colonial policy and above all, its  drive to the south and west The Third Reich intended to resume the  Germanic expansionist program where it had stopped six hundred years  ago, and to press once again over the routes of the medieval crusading  orders into the lands of the east  Thus to Weinberg and to Rich, Hitler was no opportunist but a man of unshakeable  ideological convictions, which lay at the heart of his foreign policy after 1933',\n",
       "       '  This view of Hitler was shared by a German historian, Eberhard Jäckel, in a book  The historical debate 49 robin-bobinpublished in 1984, Hitler in History Far from merely taking advantage of opportunities  presented to him by the miscalculations of other European leaders, Jackel argued that  Hitler had a clear vision of the future of the Third Reich ‘Perhaps never in history did a  ruler write down before he came to power what he was to do afterward as precisely as did  Adolf Hitler Hitler set himself two goals: a war of conquest and the elimination of the  Jews.’ According to Jäckel,  Hitler’s ultimate goal was the establishment of a greater Germany than  had ever existed before in history The way to this greater Germany was a  war of conquest fought mainly at the expense of Soviet Russia It was in  the east of the European continent that the German nation was to gain  living space (Lebensraum) for generations to come Militarily the war would be easy because Germany would be  opposed only by a disorganised country of Jewish Bolsheviks and  incompetent Slavs  For all three historians, Hitler’s ideology based on race, space and unceasing struggle  decisively differentiated Nazi foreign policy from that of previous German regimes They  therefore completely rejected Taylor’s argument that Hitler was merely pursuing  traditional German foreign-policy goals, pointing out that Hitler himself had drawn a  stark contrast between the objectives of previous German regimes and his own vision of  the future Whilst they acknowledged that German First World War leaders were aiming  at the establishment of a Mitteleuropa or sphere of German domination in central and  eastern Europe, this was in no way based on doctrines of race, and was part of a finite set  of aims which was to be achieved within a generally accepted European diplomatic  framework Stresemann may well have envisaged future German hegemony over the newly  created central European states of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and even union  with Austria, but he pursued his objectives through diplomatic means, and was certainly  not planning wars of racial conquest Unquestionably, there were common features  shared by Weimar and Nazi foreign policy: a desire to overturn the Treaty of Versailles,  to rearm, to reverse the verdict of the First World War and re-establish Germany once  again as Europe’s dominant power But in no sense did Weinberg or Rich see Hitler as a  typical German leader, aiming at the same goals as former German Chancellors or  contemporary German leaders  Hitler was not born a German subject and he could not be described as a typical  German leader in terms of his background and education, or Hindenburg would not have  referred to him so disparagingly as the ‘Bohemian corporal’ He rose  to become German Chancellor despite lacking social connections, wealth or further  education In this respect he was more like Ebert, the first Social Democratic Chancellor  in the Weimar government, but unlike Ebert he shared the expansionist ambitions of the  The origins of the second world war 1933–1941 50 robin-bobinGerman nationalists There is no doubt at all that many of his aims, if not always his  methods of achieving them, were supported by large numbers of Germans Yet by 1938,  army leaders and conservative nationalists were prepared to work against him They were  worried about his seemingly unlimited vision of German expansion, about his obsessive  drive to realize it and about his ruthless determination to crush by one means or another  all obstacles which stood in his way They did not believe he was talking for effect, and  some lost their jobs, and later their lives, as a result of their opposition to his plans',\n",
       "       ' As the American historian Sally Marks has noted, Hitler’s aims  were more vast, his ideology very different and his methods much more confrontational  than those of any previous German leaders By the 1990s, Taylor’s interpretation of  Hitler and of the origins of the Second World War had been vigorously rejected by the  great majority of historians researching inter-war history David Kaiser’s verdict, in  Modern Germany Reconsidered, edited by Gordon Martel and published in 1992, was  that Taylor’s views that ‘Hitler did not intend war in 1939 and lacked a real plan for the  conquest of Europe and of the world, and that other governments played a crucial role in  unleashing German expansionism’ can no longer be regarded as valid  However, by this time, a new debate had been raging for some years about the extent  to which the course of Nazi foreign policy had been decisively and exclusively shaped by  Hitler The point cannot be stressed too strongly Hitler was master in the Third Reich’  This view was shared by Weinberg, by Jäckel, by Bullock and by the German historians  Hildebrand and Hillgrüber They were all in agreement that Hitler was driven by a  number of ideological obsessions, that he followed a ‘programme’ if not a ‘blueprint for  action’, to which he consistently adhered, from the mid-1920s until his death in his Berlin  bunker, which was based on his ideological beliefs, and that he was in control of the  policies implemented in the Third Reich, both domestic and foreign Those who emphasized the importance of structural issues,  of competing power blocs and of a variety of constraints on Hitler’s power after 1933  were referred to as ‘structuralists’ or ‘functionalists’, and fierce argument and debate  between the two schools of thought took place from the mid-1960s through to the 1990s  Far from Hitler being master in the Third Reich, the German historian Hans  Mommsen described him in 1971 as ‘unwilling to take decisions, frequently uncertain,  exclusively concerned with upholding his prestige and personal authority, influenced in  the strongest fashion by his current entourage, in some respects a weak dictator’ In a  chapter in Walter Laqueur’s Fascism: A Reader’s Guide, first published in 1976,  Mommsen argued that ‘the regime’s foreign policy ambitions were many and varied,  without clear aims, and only linked by the ultimate goal: hindsight alone gives them some  The historical debate 51 robin-bobinair of consistency’ In this interpretation, policies were  driven not solely by Hitler as the ‘fanatical instigator’ but by army and business leaders,  and by colleagues who seized upon Hitler’s ‘spur of the moment bright idea’ and  ‘propaganda utterances…as orders for action’ to demonstrate their ‘diligence, the  efficiency of their machinery and their political indispensability’ Thus, in Mommsen’s  view, the chaotic structure of the Third Reich and the incessant competition between  individuals and factions for power and for Hitler’s favour, rather than the ideology first  expressed in Mein Kampf, crucially shaped Nazi foreign policy  Another German historian, Martin Broszat, advanced a similar view in 1970, arguing  that there was little evidence of a design or plan behind Hitler’s foreign policy Instead,  the pursuit of Lebensraum in the east reflected Hitler’s need to sustain, as Kershaw  summarized it, ‘the dynamic momentum he had helped unleash',\n",
       "       ' For Broszat, ‘the aim of winning Lebensraum in the east had until 1939 largely the function of an ideological metaphor, a symbol to  account for ever new foreign policy activity’ For Broszat, as for Mommsen, it was the  antagonistic forces at the heart of the Third Reich and the social dynamic of the Nazi  movement which necessitated ceaseless action and drove Hitler and the regime  inexorably towards turning the Lebensraum metaphor into reality Again, in this  interpretation, the structural and political context within which Hitler chose to operate  after 1933, and the strong domestic pressures and tensions which it generated, were  decisive in shaping Nazi foreign policy and in ensuring its constant radicalization  One example of such tensions was the serious economic crisis which Germany faced  after 1936, as a result of the adoption of the Four Year Plan and of ever more frenetic  rearmament Hitler was acutely conscious of the need to placate  the German working class after 1933, by making available cheap consumer goods and by  keeping down food prices This forced the regime to provide both ‘Guns’ and ‘Butter’ for  the German population, placing great strain on the economy, which was further  compounded by a growing labour shortage which enabled skilled workers to exploit their  bargaining position Thus Mason argued that the domestic political situation was  responsible for a major economic crisis by the late 1930s, which also affected foreign  trade, public finance and agriculture He believed that the leaders of the Third Reich were  well aware that they were confronting a critical domestic situation, and that this  decisively influenced the course of the foreign policy they adopted In order to maintain social peace at home  and to protect its own position, Mason argued that the Third Reich had to wage war  The origins of the second world war 1933–1941 52 robin-bobinsooner rather than later, and had to launch a series of ‘smash and grab’ raids on  neighbouring countries to acquire the raw materials and economic resources it  desperately needed to maintain and expand its armed strength without unduly exploiting  its own domestic labour force In an article in Past and Present, in December 1964, he  concluded that ‘a war for the plunder of manpower and materials lay square in the  dreadful logic of German economic development under National Socialist rule’  However, Mason’s interpretation of a domestic crisis driving Nazi Germany to war in  1939 was strongly disputed by a fellow British economic historian, Richard Overy For Overy, the year  of economic crisis for Germany was 1932, when there were 8 million unemployed, gross  national product had plunged by 45 per cent from 1928, the volume of trade had shrunk  to less than half of what it had been four years previously, there was a massive loss of  business and creditor confidence, and increasing social and political conflict and violence  led to the collapse of parliamentary rule In contrast, he pointed out that 1938 and 1939  were years of high growth, rising investment, full employment and falling interest rates,  with capital and labour markets being regulated by the state Admittedly, state regulation  did not go smoothly, was piecemeal and often uncoordinated, and resulted in fierce  competition from different sectors for increasingly scarce resources But for Overy, that  did not amount to a massive economic crisis which could be resolved only by war',\n",
       "       ' Indeed, as Overy points out,  the chemical and explosives programme, the aluminium programme,  Buna rubber [a form of synthetic rubber], synthetic fuel oil, domestic iron\\ufffeore output, the Westwall…were all well under way or completed by 1939  The state had successfully diverted 60% of industrial investment to the  programmes of the Four Year Plan…Hitler’s demands were not simple  additions, but represented a gradual switch away from investment in the  basic programme of economic rearmament to the output of manufactured  weapons The central problem faced by officials and managers was not the  imminent collapse of the whole system, but its growing and manifest  inefficiency…  Overy completely rejected the argument that the economic question as portrayed by  Mason was ‘the primary determinant in explaining the outbreak of general war in  September 1939’ In particular, Overy drew attention to the conviction which Hitler had  developed after the Munich crisis, that ‘Britain and France would not fight seriously for  Poland, or would not fight at all if Hitler called their bluff’ Hitler believed that ‘the west  had bankrupted its stock at Munich, and that the balance of power was moving in  Germany’s favour…in the aftermath of Munich and then Prague Hitler was determined to  get his free hand in the east and not to be denied it again’ Overy agrees that ‘War with  Poland would solve some of the economic problems, would help to keep the regime on  The historical debate 53 robin-bobinthe boil, and would bring [Hitler] widespread popular support and give his soldiers a first  taste of blood In this sense the war had a domestic dimension as well, and was not just  ‘foreign policy’  This view was strongly endorsed by Gerhard Weinberg in 1980, in his comprehensive  diplomatic history of pre-war Nazi Germany, when he concluded that  The power of Germany was directed by Adolf Hitler Careful analyses by  scholars have revealed internal divisions, organisational confusions,  jurisdictional battles, institutional rivalries, and local deviations behind  the facade of monolithic unity that the Third Reich liked to present to its  citizens and to the world in word and picture The fact remains, however,  that the broad lines of policy were determined in all cases by Hitler  himself Where others agreed, or at least did not object strenuously, they  were allowed the choice of going along or retreating into silence, but on  major issues of policy the Führer went his own way Even the most forceful  “structuralist” analyses accept that Hitler’s “leadership monopoly” was far more in  evidence in the foreign-policy decision-making process than in the realm of domestic  policy’ David Kaiser supported this view in his chapter in Modern Germany  Reconsidered, pointing out that Hitler was the prime mover who made the critical  foreign-policy decisions—relating to rearmament in 1933, to the remilitarization of the  Rhineland, and to Anschluss with Austria—‘often in the teeth of opposition from his  diplomats and generals’ His successes only increased his authority over them  By the 1990s, therefore, a consensus had emerged amongst historians that while ‘there  were forces at work, both within and outside Germany, conditioning the framework of  Hitler’s actions , these ‘structural determinants’, as Kershaw noted, pushed Hitler ‘if  anything still faster on the path he was in any case determined to tread’',\n",
       "       ' However, there still  remained some areas of disagreement, relating to the exact nature of Hitler’s ‘plans’ and  about whether his ultimate aim was continental or world domination  Forty years or so after the end of the Second World War, historians no longer regarded  the work which Hitler had penned whilst in prison, Mein Kampf, as establishing a  detailed blueprint for action, to be followed to the letter by Hitler, which would inevitably  lead to war Instead, there was now considerable agreement that Hitler had developed  strongly obsessive and fixed ideas about foreign policy by the early 1920s, derived from  his ideological beliefs, from which he did not subsequently deviate and which decisively  shaped his foreign policy after 1933 However, historians point out that he was very clear  about his preliminary objectives, the urgent need for German rearmament and the  removal of the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles, telling his army generals in 1933  about the importance of the ‘struggle against Versailles’ and the need to prepare for the  conquest of new living space in the east Once Germany’s western flank had been  safeguarded by the return of the Saar in 1935, the remilitarization of the Rhineland in  1936 and greatly increased levels of military strength, Hitler could then turn to pursue  racial and territorial objectives in eastern Europe, bringing into Germany the German\\ufffespeaking peoples of Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland, and preparing for a struggle  with Poland But all the while, there was a bigger goal, making Germany ready for a  major war against Russia, preceded, if necessary, by action against France and possibly  Britain, if the latter refused an alliance with Germany The German historian Andreas  Hillgrüber had suggested already in the 1960s that Hitler was following a Stufenplan or  three-stage plan for establishing German hegemony first over Europe, then over the  Middle East and other British colonial territory and, more distantly, over the United  States and thus the whole world Klaus Hildebrand agreed that Hitler pursued a ‘carefully  calculated stage by stage plan’ which proceeded from the gaining of Lebensraum in  eastern Europe to the destruction of the Soviet Union and ultimately aimed at an eventual  ‘war for world domination’ Other historians have rejected such a neat formulation,  whilst not denying the driving forces and central aims of Hitler’s foreign policy, but  taking more note of Hitler’s many improvisations, political opportunism and tactical  flexibility As Richard Overy’s research has established,  between 1936 and 1939 two-thirds of the German economy was devoted to preparing for  war, with a quarter of the German work force, by 1939, directly engaged in war-related  industries In 1938, 52 per cent of government expenditure, and 17 per cent of Germany’s  gross domestic product was being spent on armaments, a level which exceeded the  combined expenditure on armaments of Britain, France and the United States In Overy’s  view, Hitler’s prime objective was to prepare Germany for a major military confrontation  with Russia, which he expected to take place at some point in the early 1940s; a war over  Poland at an earlier date was not his main aim, though German armed forces were to be  ready to fight, if necessary, to restore Danzig and the Polish corridor to Germany if the  western powers were not willing to acquiesce in their return',\n",
       "       ' At the same time, Overy has argued that, by the late 1930s, Hitler saw a window  of opportunity opening up for Germany, in that he perceived Britain and France to be in  inexorable decline, whilst the United States and Japan, two potential world powers, were  not yet in a dominant position Thus Nazi Germany needed to capitalize on this  favourable situation, which was not likely to persist for very many years  The historical debate 55 robin-bobinSo, after the great showdown with Russia, was there to be a second conflict, to wrest  control of the Middle East oil fields from the grip of the western democracies, and a third,  against the United States, for global domination Such evidence as we have is not  conclusive, but those historians who believe that Hitler’s ambitions did embrace eventual  world domination point to the ‘Z plan’, adopted in January 1939, which was aimed at a  huge expansion of Germany’s navy  The objective was clearly to enable Germany to be ready for conflict with the world’s  leading naval powers—the United States, Britain and possibly also Japan Alongside this  naval expansion, resources were also to be made available for the development of long\\uffferange bombers which would have the capability to fly to America and back, the ‘America  bomber’ as the model came to be called Further supporting evidence that Hitler was  already looking ahead to a conflict against the United States for world domination comes  in the form of information received by the United States Ambassador in Paris, William  Bullitt, in the year before the outbreak of war, which he quickly passed on to President  Roosevelt According to Bullitt’s source, Otto von Habsburg, Hitler had held a meeting at  Berchtesgaden on 8 March 1939, at which he emphasized that German survival depended  on seizing sources of raw materials and eliminating Germany’s enemies, namely the Jews  and the democracies Hitler  was quoted as saying that Germany would no longer have to suffer insults from President  Roosevelt ‘We will settle accounts with the Jews of the dollar…we will exterminate the  Jewish democracy, and Jewish blood will mix itself with the dollars’ However, this was  fairly soon after the events of Kristallnacht, about which President Roosevelt had had the  temerity to remonstrate with Hitler, thus perhaps provoking a characteristically explosive  response from the German dictator Nevertheless, the first part of Hitler’s prophecy  proved to be chillingly accurate Global conflicts against the British empire and against the United  States for world domination might well have followed But this takes us into the realms  of speculation, where the evidence is patchy and inconclusive What we can say is that  historians are now generally agreed that by 1939 Hitler was gearing Germany up for a  major conflict, not over Poland which he expected to conquer without serious opposition  from the western democracies, but with Bolshevik Russia',\n",
       "       '  Thus the debate has shifted in recent years to look afresh at British and French  diplomacy in the inter-war period, and particularly after Munich, and to assess why an  alliance between the western powers and Russia, with the aim of containing German  aggression, was not concluded In the past twenty-five years, British and French  appeasement policies have been reappraised, in the light of newly available archival  sources, and the contempt of an earlier generation of historians has been replaced by a  much more sympathetic understanding of the strategic dilemmas facing British and  French statesmen in the shadow of the Great War Anthony Adamthwaite, in his study of inter\\ufffewar French strategy and diplomacy, Grandeur and Misery, has similarly highlighted  French military and economic weakness in the 1920s, a theme also taken up by many  American historians, amongst them Stephen Shuker, William McDougall and Sally  Marks All these historians stress the extent to which the First World War had  impoverished Britain and particularly France With massive war debts to pay off, and  markets to recapture, both countries sought stability in Europe and looked to the United  States for economic and military assistance both in enforcing the peace settlement and in  promoting European recovery But instead the American government repudiated  President Wilson’s diplomacy, and withdrew from European involvement, leaving  Britain and France to police the settlement alone, in the face of a new challenge, the  emergence of Bolshevik Russia At the  same time, Russian leaders singled out the British empire as a particular enemy, with  Zinoviev in 1920 calling for a ‘holy war…against British Imperialism’ British Foreign  Secretary Curzon described the ‘Russian menace in the East’ in the early 1920s as  ‘incomparably greater than anything else that has happened in my lifetime to the British  Empire’  Thus fear of communism was a major factor shaping appeasement policies in the  1920s and 1930s, as ideological conflict and class warfare divided countries and spread  across Europe This was yet another factor driving the British and French governments to  increase expenditure on economic and social recovery, in a bid to stave off worker  militancy and alienation But this meant that money was not available to spend on  defence and on the protection of colonies overseas, at a time when the British empire in  particular had grown to its greatest ever territorial extent By  the 1930s, it was not just Bolshevik Russia which posed a serious challenge; Italian  ambitions in the Mediterranean, Japanese aggression on the Chinese mainland and United  States naval diplomacy were also causing great concern to British and French leaders  The historical debate 57 robin-bobinThus historians now argue that the responses of the British and French governments to  Hitler after 1933 have to be seen in the light of the complex and serious global challenges  they were facing  Historians such as Michael Howard in The Continental Commitment and David Dilks  in his contribution to Adrian Preston’s General Staffs and Diplomacy before the Second  World War have stressed Britain’s military weakness in the 1930s, and the fact that the  three British military services were planning for three different wars',\n",
       "       ' Baldwin and Chamberlain were repeatedly warned by their chiefs  of staff that Britain did not have the military resources to contemplate war against  Germany and Japan simultaneously if Italy was also hostile in the vital Mediterranean  area Chamberlain was active in the mid-1930s in supporting schemes of rearmament and  in then pushing for the development of measures for air defence At the same time he  recognized the great dangers facing the British empire and the urgent need to try to come  to terms with Mussolini or with Hitler in respect of their territorial claims  French defence planning, as Robert Young has shown in In Command of France and  in his chapter in General Staffs and Diplomacy before the Second World War, was geared  to defence of the Maginot line and to the mobilization of resources to enable France to  survive a long war of attrition French  calculations that British aid would be vital in any future war led to acquiescence in  Britain’s reluctance to challenge Hitler in eastern Europe before 1939 At the fateful  Munich conference in 1938, French leaders took the view that British support was more  crucial than obligations to Czechoslovakia or to Poland But, once these allies were lost,  British support for France and involvement in eastern Europe became vital if resistance to  Hitler was to be organized And because of the multiple challenges facing the British  empire in the 1930s, as well as lingering guilt over the perceived iniquities of the Treaty  of Versailles, this support and promise of involvement were slow in coming  Since the collapse of the Habsburg and Romanov empires at the end of the First World  War, British leaders had perceived central Europe to be an area of weakness, fragmented  by the emergence of new states such as Czechoslovakia, Austria and Hungary Not only were they seen  as unstable and economically weak; they also contained a volatile ethnic mix of peoples,  including strong German communities who saw their future as lying inside an expanded  Germany There was from 1919 a strong feeling in Britain that the Treaty of Versailles  had been unfair to Germany, not least because Wilson’s celebrated nationality principles  had been denied to the new Weimar republic Thus successive British governments from  1919 onwards, preoccupied with safeguarding the empire and promoting economic  recovery, sought to appease Germany and in due course to bring about peaceful revision  of the Versailles settlement, particularly with regard to Germany’s eastern frontiers, the  stringent disarmament clauses and the occupation of the Rhineland There was little surprise in Britain that Hitler  denounced the Versailles restrictions on German armament levels and walked out of the  League Disarmament Conference, that he aimed to remilitarize the Rhineland and that he  sought Anschluss with Austria British leaders certainly deplored the aggressive way in  which he tore up the successive clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, but this made them  only the more anxious to try to reach agreement with him over what they believed to be a  limited set of Nazi objectives  However, even though there is now a much greater understanding of and sympathy on  the part of historians writing in the past twenty years for the appeasement policies  pursued by Britain and France in the inter-war period, Neville Chamberlain remains a  controversial figure',\n",
       "       ' In Dilks’ view, ‘We shall judge ministers of the 1930s more fairly if  we conceive of them as men grappling with a deadly situation, contemplating the early  outbreak of a war which they believed would be more horrible in its devastation and  bloodletting than any previously recorded’ Chamberlain was very conscious of the fact  that war had broken out to a large degree in 1914 because Germany had perceived itself  to be encircled by the entente powers of France, Britain and Russia He wanted to avoid  making the same mistake again, and provoking Hitler to some ‘mad dog act’ by the  adoption of strong deterrent policies on the part of Britain and France He always thought he was  right, and never mistaken; furthermore he hated opposition and criticism, and found it  difficult to be agreeable to his critics He was opposed to the consistent anti-German line  taken by the permanent under-secretary in the British Foreign Office, Vansittart, and to  the tendency of the Foreign Office, as he saw it, to view continuity of Prussian  expansionism in every suggestion of Hitler He removed Vansittart from the centre of  foreign-policy decision-making, and surrounded himself instead by officials who shared  his own outlook He found Churchill’s anti-Nazi tub-thumping grossly alarmist Instead,  he viewed Hitler as a ‘man of moods’ who, if reasoned with by such a consummate  political operator as Chamberlain himself, ‘would give you anything you ask for’ He told  his sister that ‘here was a man who could be relied on when he had given his word’ His optimism was not universally  shared even at the time by his political colleagues; many historians continue to regard  him as a short-sighted, dogmatic political leader, hopelessly naive and ill-informed about  Hitler’s personality and about the ideological beliefs and grandiose ambitions which were  driving the German dictator As Sidney Astor has written in his chapter in Paths to War:  The historical debate 59 robin-bobinnew essays on the origins of the Second World War edited by Boyce and Robertson,  ‘what emerges from the Chamberlain papers is misplaced trust, unwarranted optimism  and erroneous judgements Confidence in the ultimate success of appeasement…hindered  Chamberlain’s assessment of alternatives’ Indeed, he believed that he had  been outmanoeuvred by the scheming Chamberlain, and angrily resolved that he would  not allow the British leader to foil his military intentions again over Danzig Thus  Chamberlain’s diplomacy can now be seen to have had some success in the short term,  and it gave Britain a further few months in which to rearm By the time war finally came,  in September 1939, following the Nazi invasion of Prague in March, the deadly threat  which Hitler posed to Europe and to global stability could be clearly seen not just in  Britain but throughout the British empire Britain, its dominions and its colonies entered  the war as a united force in 1939 As Michael Fry points out in his contribution to The  Munich Crisis, 1938, edited by Lukes and Goldstein, that would certainly not have been  the case had war come over the Sudetenland in 1938  By early 1939 there was widespread opposition in Britain to the continuing  appeasement of Hitler’s expansionist ambitions',\n",
       "       ' He  further points out that, by early 1939, there was ‘a clearly stated alternative to the  government’s policy towards Germany Where the government stressed conciliation  towards Hitler… Chamberlain’s opponents preferred “the language of the mailed fist”  They wanted military alliances to encircle Germany, alliances dressed up in the language,  and cloaked by the procedures, of the League of Nations’ And though, as we have seen,  Chamberlain rejected this approach on the grounds that it would be more likely to  provoke Hitler to military retaliation rather than to contain him, and because he had lost  faith in the League’s capacity to operate effectively after the failure of economic  sanctions against Italy in the Abyssinian crisis, Hitler’s occupation of Prague in March  1939 forced him to change tack As he later informed the House of  Commons, this was ‘not a policy of lining up opposing blocs of Powers in Europe…and  accepting the view that war is inevitable’  Those who remain strong critics of Chamberlain, such as R.A.C Parker and Sidney  Astor argue that he was too stubborn and too blinded by his prejudices to accept that by  the end of 1938 coherent deterrence policies against Hitler offered the only means of  preventing the outbreak of a European war Parker’s verdict on Chamberlain is a harsh  one: he believes that it would have been possible for Chamberlain after March 1939 to  secure sufficient support in parliament and in the country at large for a close alliance with  France and for a policy of containing and encircling Germany within the framework of  The origins of the second world war 1933–1941 60 robin-bobinthe League Instead, ‘his search for agreement with Hitler strengthened both Hitler’s  ambitions and his internal authority’  This charge, which to some degree echoes the much earlier post-war interpretation of  ‘guilty men’, rests very much on the assumption that effective deterrence could have been  organized and led by the British government in the late 1930s We have already seen that  both British and French leaders were constrained in their responses to Hitler by the  military weakness of their countries in the face of vigorous German rearmament, the  scale of which, as we now know, both they and Hitler exaggerated No League reprisals  had been forthcoming to prevent German rearmament in the mid-1930s or to punish  Germany in any way for flouting the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles over  disarmament and the remilitarization of the Rhineland Though the Soviet Union had  become a member of the League of Nations in 1934 and was urging the formation of  popular fronts across Europe to fight fascism, this proved to be a divisive rather than  unifying theme, particularly in France and in Spain From a Russian perspective, the actions of its two fellow  League powers up to the end of 1938, particularly during the Munich conference, did not  suggest that they placed any great value on working in collaboration with Russia or had  any intention of employing policies of deterrence against Hitler  Thus the question we need to consider is whether by 1939 it would still have been  possible for Britain and France to come to an understanding with Russia to enable the  three powers to conclude a guarantee or military pact to contain Hitler Suspicions were  high on both sides, after nearly two decades of ideological warfare between communist  Russia and the capitalist western powers Substantial bodies of public opinion, in both  Britain and France, saw communism as a greater danger than Nazism, and believed that  any outbreak of major war would inevitably end in the triumph and expansion of Soviet  Russia',\n",
       "       ' Thus both governments were advised that, while Soviet troops could  undoubtedly be counted on to defend Soviet territory, they had been seriously weakened  as an attacking force For his part, Stalin was intensely suspicious of the motives of  Chamberlain and Daladier, believing that their intention was to fend off German military  aggression to the west by encouraging the Nazis to expand eastwards The Munich  conference only confirmed him in this belief  Looking back with the benefit of hindsight, it is very clear to see that Chamberlain’s  half-hearted efforts to woo Russia after March 1939 were doomed to failure  Chamberlain himself placed little value on Russian military power, and feared that  attempts to co-operate with the Soviet Union would seriously complicate relations with  Poland and Romania, to which Britain had just given military guarantees of assistance,  and would gravely antagonize Germany As Lloyd George pointed out in the House of Commons in April 1939,  The historical debate 61 robin-bobin‘Without the help of Russia, we are walking into a trap’ Chamberlain’s attempt to  frighten Hitler through the guarantee to Poland had the effect instead of increasing  Russia’s options As Adam Ulam, in his study of Russian foreign policy between 1917  and 1973, Expansion and Co-Existence, claims, this guarantee made possible the train of  events which led to the Russo-German pact of August 1939, since it gave the Russian  government a freedom of manoeuvre that it would not otherwise have enjoyed Stalin was  able to play off Britain and France against Germany and to demand ever more binding  agreements and terms, including the entry of Russian troops into Poland and Romania,  which Britain felt unable to accept in the light of the strenuous refusal of both countries  to agree to such ‘assistance’ He wrote to his  sister Hilda at the end of June 1939, ‘My colleagues are so desperately anxious’ for an  agreement with the Soviet Union and ‘so nervous of the consequences of failure to  achieve it that I have to go warily but I am so sceptical of the value of Russian help that I  should not feel our position was greatly worsened if we had to do without them’ At the  same time, as Parker points out in Chamberlain and Appeasement, in Pravda, the official  communist newspaper in Russia, Zhdanov was voicing his opinion that Britain and  France ‘do not want a real agreement or one acceptable to the USSR: the only thing they  really want is to talk about an agreement, and by making play with the obstinacy of the  Soviet Union, to prepare their own public opinion for an eventual deal with the  aggressors’ Perhaps not surprisingly, by August Stalin decided that Soviet Russia’s  strategic interests were best served, at least in the short term, by a pact with Nazi  Germany There were enormous difficulties to be  overcome, not least in the shape of strong Russian interests in eastern Poland, in Romania  and in the Baltic states which Britain would never have found easy to accommodate  Furthermore, the Russians wanted guarantees about levels of armament to be deployed,  which both France and Britain would have struggled to meet And hanging over all these  issues was the question of trust: could Stalin be trusted to keep to his side of the bargain,  or would he at some point have been tempted by rival offers from Hitler A policy of  deterrence could work only if all three powers could identify clear interests in common,  which would maintain strong bonds of unity The challenge for Hitler would have been to  try to break up any alignments which threatened to encircle Germany, and it is by no  means certain that, had a pact been concluded between Britain, France and Soviet Russia,  it would have remained in existence for long',\n",
       "       '  But it is less clear that a pact with Russia was feasible, or that it would have prevented  war from breaking out The evidence which is now available to us reveals very clearly the  scale of Hitler’s territorial ambitions and his ruthless determination to bring Germany to a  state of readiness which would enable them to be achieved through military conflict It is  difficult, in the face of such evidence, to believe that he could have been contained by  other European powers for very long, especially when he could call on the support of  Italy and Japan to menace western interests in the Mediterranean and in the Far East We  The origins of the second world war 1933–1941 62 robin-bobinalso now have a much clearer, though by no means complete, picture of the emergence of  Russian strategy in the mid- and late 1930s, which suggests that Stalin’s overriding  concern during this period was to safeguard Soviet interests  There has been considerable debate about the factors shaping Soviet foreign policy in  the 1930s Was Russia sincere in trying to promote collective security policies through  the League and through the formation of popular front coalitions to combat fascism Or  was this merely a façade, behind which secretive Soviet overtures were ever more  insistently being directed at Nazi agents Was Stalin’s preference all along really for  alliance with Hitler, as some historians such as Gerhard Weinberg and Robert C.Tucker  have alleged We know that there was sharp disagreement over Stalin’s motives in  Britain by the late 1930s While some people were convinced of the sincerity of Russia’s  pursuit of collective security, others, notably Chamberlain as we have seen, regarded  Russia’s League diplomacy from the mid-1930s as ‘a duplicitous attempt to divide  Britain and France from Germany, provoke war and revolution, and pave the way for  Soviet expansion’ As he told the  1934 Party Congress, ‘We never had any orientation towards Germany, nor have we any  orientation towards Poland and France Our orientation in the past and…at the present  time is towards the USSR and towards the USSR alone’ As Teddy Ulricks has argued, in  his contribution to Soviet Foreign Policy 1917–1991, edited by Gabriel Gorodetsky,  ‘There was only one foreign policy line, both before and after 1933 and, for that matter,  after August 1939 That line included the assumption of hostility from all of the  imperialist powers and, therefore, the need to keep them divided…Throughout the  decade, suspicion of all imperialist powers and a desperate search for security remained  constant.’ Geoffrey Roberts, in The Soviet Union and the Origins of the Second World  War, endorses this view of the Soviet Union keeping its options open, negotiating for a  military alliance with Britain and France but at the same time leaving open the door to  Nazi advances But not until the moment of the final  breakdown of the military negotiations with Britain and France were the Germans invited  across the threshold.’ Patrick Finney’s summary of Soviet motivations, in The Origins of  the Second World War, is that  The interpretation which best fits the evidence is that which sees Stalin  mainly preoccupied with the search for security in a hostile capitalist  world Once Nazi Germany had obviously become the Soviet Union’s  chief potential enemy, Stalin launched the collective security campaign,  yet prudence dictated that the door should be left open for the restoration  of amicable relations with Berlin if German policy changed By the same  token, suspicion of the western powers never evaporated, and Stalin was  determined not to be manoeuvred into a war with Germany from which  The historical debate 63 robin-bobinBritain and France would stand aloof, and it was fear of this which finally  provoked the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact',\n",
       "       ' It was much easier for Nazi Germany and the Soviet  Union to come to an agreement which effectively assigned ‘spheres of influence’ in  eastern Europe between the two of them, with each power harbouring an intention to  build up power in its allotted sphere and to turn on the other when the moment was right  If it was highly unlikely that Britain and France could work with the Soviet Union to  contain Hitler, how realistic were Chamberlain’s hopes, and those of Pierre Laval in  France, of forming a common front with Mussolini against Nazi expansion We know  that, in 1934 and 1935, French leaders tried hard to court Mussolini and enlist him in the  struggle against Hitler, but that their willingness to accommodate his African colonial  ambitions, particularly through the infamous Hoare-Laval pact, fell foul of their  undertakings as a League power Equally, Chamberlain’s attempts to make concessions  to Italy in 1938 and to detach Italy from the Nazi camp, failed completely Or was he inevitably driven towards Hitler because of his fascist beliefs and  admiration for the Nazi leader  Historians of Fascist Italy continue to have conflicting views about the factors shaping  Mussolini’s foreign policy Mussolini’s Italian biographer, De Felice, has argued that,  from the mid-1920s to 1935 and even beyond, Mussolini’s overriding objective was to  secure France’s agreement to the establishment of Italy as a great power, with an  expanded colonial empire in North Africa In order to achieve this, Mussolini’s advisers  urged him to follow the ‘policy of the decisive weight’ in the European balance, or the  ‘policy of the pendulum’ as it was called This concept, also pursued by Liberal Italian  governments before 1914, entailed, according to Dino Grandi, Mussolini’s minister of  foreign affairs, ‘making one side or the other pay very dearly for our help at the right  time’ As Pierre Guillen has observed, in his contribution to French  Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918–1940, edited by Robert Boyce, the period saw  a succession of phases of tension and…of rapprochement The phases of  rapprochement corresponded to the times when the French and Italians  judged their interests to outweigh their differences and to warrant mutual  concessions; the phases of tension were marked by French irritation in  face of Italian claims, and by Italian disappointment at French refusal to  take their claims into account Generally speaking, these alternations  occurred because, although French leaders favoured an entente with Italy,  they were not prepared to pay the price that Italy demanded  So did Mussolini begin to edge closer to Hitler only after the Abyssinian crisis, when  Britain had forced France to operate against Italian aggression within the machinery of  the League of Nations and to agree to economic sanctions against Italy MacGregor Knox argues, in his contribution to  The Origins of the Second World War, edited by Patrick Finney, that in matters of foreign  policy Mussolini was no pragmatic realist but an ideologue, driven by grandiose visions  of Italian Mediterranean expansion Knox informs us that Grandi repeatedly referred to  the fact that ‘Mussolini has an unreal conception of diplomacy He calls this conception  revolutionary, but the truth is that it is unreal’ In a striking extract from his diary, written  in 1932, Grandi muses:  I have asked myself why the Boss is so taken with Hitler',\n",
       "       ' Mussolini does not love Cavour; he never did  In this interpretation, Mussolini aimed from the mid-1920s, according to Germany’s  ambassador in Rome in December 1924, Neurath, ‘to make the Mediterranean a mare  italiano In that effort France stood in the way, and he had begun to prepare for battle  with that adversary’ Mussolini believed that  the situation in Europe created by the Versailles Treaty was untenable In  the new war between France and Germany that would therefore break out,  Italy, led by Mussolini, would place itself at Germany’s side in order to  crush France jointly If that endeavour succeeded, Mussolini would claim  as his booty the entire French North African coast and create a great  imperium latinum in the Mediterranean  So in this interpretation, Mussolini’s eyes were firmly set on Italian territorial and  colonial expansion from the mid-1920s, with a revisionist Germany his obvious partner But preparations for ‘the total conquest’ of  Abyssinia none the less went full steam ahead, and Mussolini announced privately in  1935 that ‘afterwards we shall conquer Egypt and the Sudan!’ The fact that Italy lacked  the economic and military strength to pursue Mussolini’s grandiose vision effectively,  and that it increasingly looked to Nazi Germany for assistance simply took the Italian  dictator, it is argued, more quickly and more irrevocably to Hitler’s side where he had  long aimed to be The Italian-German axis was strengthened by the involvement of the  two powers in the Spanish civil war alongside General Franco, and, by the time Neville  Chamberlain became prime minister in Britain, it was no longer possible, even if it might  have been in earlier years, to negotiate concessions with Mussolini and wean him away  The historical debate 65 robin-bobinfrom the Nazi camp On this point, at least, there is agreement amongst historians of  inter-war Italian foreign policy It is hardly surprising, therefore, that British and French leaders  struggled to maintain international peace in the inter-war period, and lurched from crisis  to crisis, anxious to avoid war but unsure of how this could be accomplished Without  doubt, many people in Britain underestimated the ideological fervour and aggressive  intent of Nazi and Italian expansionist policies while at the same time fearing the threat  of the spread of communism; they also feared the aerial bombardment and associated  horrors that another war would inevitably bring, and found it difficult to believe that  those who had experienced the agony of the First World War could seriously be  contemplating the outbreak of a second No wonder British and French statesmen struggled after  1933 to find answers to the mounting challenges posed by a group of powers intent on  overthrowing the prevailing international order  This brings into play the inter-war role of the United States The failure of successive  presidents, after Wilson, to engage in European diplomacy or to work with European  powers to promote economic recovery undoubtedly increased considerably the problems  facing those countries which were struggling to maintain European peace The Wall  Street crash, fuelled by domestic factors in the United States, set off an economic  depression which had catastrophic consequences for Europe, not least in the emergence  of Nazism as a serious political force in Germany To what extent was the United States  administration concerned about the threat posed to the European and international order  by Hitler after 1933, and what actions did it take to try to prevent the outbreak of  hostilities',\n",
       "       '  Some historians, such as Arnold Offner, in his contribution to The Fascist Challenge  and the Policy of Appeasement, edited by Mommsen and Kettenacker, have argued that  the United States sought to appease Hitler, and did not change this stance until 1940, by  which time it had become abundantly clear to Roosevelt and his advisers that Hitler was  beyond appeasement and was instead well on the way to constituting a serious threat to  world order The roots of this appeasement policy, it is argued, lay in antipathy to the  Versailles peace settlement, a continuing mistrust of British and French intentions and  some sympathy for German revisionist ambitions, many of which were seen as  legitimate Thus, according to this interpretation, American statesmen and emissaries to  Europe in the mid- to late 1930s hoped to bring about a peaceful programme of modest  political and economic change which would satisfy Nazi ambitions and be agreeable to  the British and French governments  Other historians disagree with this view of American policy and argue that Roosevelt  did take steps in the later 1930s to try to contain German power through economic  pressure It is also argued, for example by Richard Harrison in his contribution to  Appeasement in Europe, edited by Schmitz and Challener, that the President was fully  alive to the dangers posed by German expansionism and tried to concert resistance  towards Hitler but was frustrated by Chamberlain’s determination to conclude a bilateral  Anglo-German agreement In addition, of course, Roosevelt had to work with a House of  Representatives and appeal to an American public, large sections of both of which saw no  advantage to the United States in becoming drawn into European affairs In this interpretation, significant differences divided the United  States and Britain, not least conflicting views over the future of the British empire, and  the American desire to pursue the ‘Open Door’ system as the basis of world trade in  opposition to the British system of imperial preference endorsed by the Ottowa  agreements As Finney observes, ‘Given these divergent interests, it was, perhaps, no  surprise that the two powers failed to co-ordinate a policy towards Germany, whether of  conciliation or resistance, until the pressing exigencies of war in 1940 temporarily  suppressed their differences and facilitated a common front’  The failure, for whatever reasons, of the two powers to work together was as  significant in the Far East as it was in Europe The extent of Japan’s ambitions had become clear from the  early 1930s, when, as Barnhart points out in Japan and the World since 1868, Japan struck out on its own by leaving the League of Nations …in  defiance of the old order of international relations At the same time, its  leaders, mainly its army, attempted to overthrow the old order within  Japan, too Japan’s new order, therefore, would have two parts Abroad,  Japan would pursue an independent course, casting aside all hope of co\\ufffeoperating with the West Manchuria…would be an integral part of the  Japanese Empire The rest of China…would fall under Japan’s  influence… The Soviet Union…would be neutralized by Japan’s  association with Germany, newly resurgent under Adolf Hitler and his  National Socialist Party Japan would use its acquisitions to build up a  power base so great that no Western power would be able to challenge it  in the future',\n",
       "       ' This ambitious international  programme also required a new order within Japan  Historians such as Richard Storry in The Double Patriots and W.G Beasley in Japanese  Imperialism, 1894–1945 have graphically documented the ideological fervour which  drove zealous Japanese patriots to reshape domestic politics within Japan in the period up  to 1936, and which fed into ever-more ambitious schemes of Japanese imperial  expansion  Given British and French preoccupations with Europe, the Middle East and India, it  was understandably difficult for the two powers to contain growing Japanese power in  east Asia, though its longer-term menace to their Asian colonies and economic interests  was clear to see Nor could it have offset the damaging impact to  Japan of the depression, nor the radicalization of Japanese political and economic life  which resulted Thus the more important question is why it was not possible for the two  western powers with the most extensive economic and colonial interests in the Far East,  namely Britain and the United States, to work together to contain Japanese expansion As  in the European sphere, there was considerable misunderstanding and suspicion on both  sides During the Manchurian crisis in the early 1930s, the fact that Britain was trying to  coordinate responses to the Japanese occupation of Manchuria through the League of  Nations, whilst the United States insisted on operating through the Washington  agreements of 1922, did not help to build up amicable relations Each saw the other as selfish, as wedded to the pursuit of  self-interest and as an unreliable partner Again, it was not until the late 1930s, with  Japan firmly entrenched on the Chinese mainland and aiming to expand southwards, that  a growing sense of alarm and determination to take some action to challenge growing  Japanese power brought Britain and America to work together more closely The effect,  however, was not to overawe Japan but to propel it into pre-emptive action, culminating  in the coup de grâce against the American fleet at Pearl Harbor, and the entry of America  into the war  Thus even had the two powers found a basis for concerted action before 1940, it is by  no means certain that earlier attempts at containment would have prevented the outbreak  of hostilities in the Pacific As with Hitler in Europe, firmer action at an earlier stage,  rather than preventing war, might instead have precipitated it The careful  scholarship of historians of Japan in revealing the roots of inter-war ultranationalism has  been matched in recent years by Ian Kershaw’s magisterial and comprehensive two\\ufffevolume biography of Hitler, which leaves us in no doubt that Hitler was intent on  revolutionary change in Germany and on the reshaping of the international order to  The origins of the second world war 1933–1941 68 robin-bobinachieve German ascendancy Only the most resolute action by a combination of powers  acting in concert could have hoped to contain the combined ambitions of Japanese and  Nazi fanatics and, in the wake of the Great War and its debilitating impact, such a  strategy of deterrence was extremely unlikely to be adopted  In the last resort, then, it could be argued that the origins of the Second World War, in  Finney’s words, lie in ‘the destructive challenge posed by the revisionist powers to the  international order established after the first world war’',\n",
       "       ' Similarly, in Italy, a failure to secure what was felt to be its rightful  share of territorial spoils from the war led to a nationalist backlash, the seizure of Fiume  and the rise to power of Mussolini and the Fascist Party Japan had entered the First  World War to gain economic concessions and territorial rights on the Chinese mainland  and in the north Pacific After 1919 its governments sought to consolidate and to extend  Japanese power by any means available And, of course, potentially the most revisionist  regime of all, Bolshevik Russia, arguably owed its existence to the strain of the First  World War on the Romanov empire Bloodcurdling communist calls to subvert the  existing capitalist order, which reverberated around Europe after 1917, could not fail to  cause serious concern to political and economic leaders across the continent Already in 1919, Foch could lament that ‘This is not peace It is an armistice  for twenty years’ Taylor took up this theme in his Origins of the Second World War when he argued that another war had been implicit ‘since the moment when the first war  ended’ Ian Kershaw has argued persuasively that Hitler’s combination of bullying and  blackmail could not have worked ‘but for the fragility of the post-war European  settlement’ The Treaty of Versailles had left ethnic unrest in central and eastern Europe  and an uneasy guilt complex in Britain And the British and French publics wanted no  second war Yet nothing in history is inevitable It is possible to see many points in the  1920s and 1930s when events might have turned out differently, and when an alternative  choice of options might have led to a quite different result, with a range of knock-on  effects If some issues have become more clear-cut in the past seventy years, the diverse  range of economic, strategic, geopolitical and social factors which historians now claim  deserve to be taken into account has escalated alarmingly Thus to reach definitive  conclusions on the origins of the Second World War remains a daunting task, not just for  the A level or university student but even for the most dedicated inter-war scholar It is  hoped that this chapter will have helped rather than have hindered this process  The historical debate 69 robin-bobin4  Guide to further reading  General surveys There are so many general outline surveys and collections of essays on the origins of the  Second World War that it is difficult to know where to begin A good starting point is  Professor Richard Overy’s The Origins of the Second World War (London, 1987), which  can be supplemented with his The Inter-War Crisis (London, 1994) Bell’s The Origins of the Second World War in Europe (London, 1986) Slightly dated but still useful is Esmonde Robertson’s edited collection  of essays, The Origins of the Second World War (London, 1971), with contributions from  A.J.P.Taylor, Alan Bullock, Hugh Trevor-Roper and Tim Mason amongst others Clearly  students will want to see why there was so much controversy over Taylor’s interpretation  by reading A.J.P.Taylor, The Origins of the Second World War (London, 1961; second  edition, with new introduction, 1963) This should be read in conjunction with two  stimulating collections of essays edited by Gordon Martel, The Origins of the Second  World War Reconsidered: The A.J.P.Taylor Debate After Twenty-Five Years (London,  1986) and The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered: A.J.P.Taylor and the  Historians (London, 1999)',\n",
