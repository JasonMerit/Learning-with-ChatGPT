# Learning with ChatGPT I
 02466 Project work

In this repository can be found our development files for making and testing the pipeline, models, and calculating results. The second main folder is for the website where the two A/B test took place.

In the development folder is notebooks such that q_w_chat.ipynb and result_generation.ipynb under Neural Search may be of particular interest as we here make the data set while also send requests to ChatGPT for questions, and create embeddings for the data, train IR models and make the ROC curves respectively. Small mentioning can also go to voting_result_generation.ipynb for creating the voting ROC curve and book_visuals.ipynb for visualizing where the IR model found a context in the books.

As for the web...
